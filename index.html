      Good morning, afternoon, or evening. This webpage is here to showcase some
      of my hobbies and interests. Not all, of course, but some of the
      <span> larger</span>
      ones.
      <br />
      The main 3 hobbies i will discuss here are: painting, video games, and
      exercise.
      <br />
      Below: a summary of each of the listed hobbies / interests.
      <br />
      <br />
      Painting: This hobby is not necessarily painting on a canvas, but rather
      painting models (Warhammer, etc.)
      <br />
      <br />
      Video Games: The 3 categories of video games i play the most are RTS
      games, RPG games, and <u>some</u> shooters (Specifically Halo and Apex
      Legends).
      <br />
      <br />
      Exercise: While it certainly isnt always at the top of my priorities, i
      still do plenty of exercise work, mainly focused on running, both outdoors
      and on a treadmill.
