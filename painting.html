      <h1><u>Painting</u></h1>
    </div>
    <p>
      There are plenty of types of painting, whether its on a canvas or
      otherwise. the version of painting i enjoy in particular is model
      painting.
      <br />
      As for what types of models i like painting, those from the warhammer
      franchises are some of my favorites. Getting into the hobby was slow
      going.
      <br />
      In particular, the pricing of some of the nicer models was somewhat of a
      concern. When getting into the hobby, there was 1 youtube channel in
      particular that helped me get interested.
      <br />
      The first was a channel known as Play On Tabletop. This channel's whole
      style is presenting tabletop wargames in a quick and condensed format, and
      presenting information in a sussinct manner. Games of warhammer 40k will
      typically take multiple hours to complete, so their ability to condense it
      down was very helpful.
      <br />
      Most of all, the production quality in their videos is unmatched in the
      scene of tabletop games. Not only are the videos themselves impressively
      made, but the paint jobs showcased on different armies really gave me
      inspiration to work harder.
