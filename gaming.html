      I play a a lot of video games in my free time. its fast, and can be
      started up faster than the preparation time with something like painting
      or exercising. The games that i enjoy playing are primarily strategy
      games. of these strategy games, there are 3 that i enjoy the most.

    <h2>Starcraft 2</h2>
    <p>
      Starcraft 2 is one of my favorite games that i have played. It's a Real
      Time Strategy game made by Blizzard in 2010, with DLC content releasing in
      2013 and 2015.
      <br />
      In this game, you select one of 3 races to play:
      <br />
    </p>
    <h2>Terran</h2>
    <img

      alt="Pictured: the Terran Insignia"
      width="200"
      height="200"
    />
    <p>
      The Terran's strengths depend on strong static fortresses on defense, and
      heavy armor supported by hordes of expendable infantry. A standard Terran
      marine alone cannot do very much, but they are cheap and fast to produce.
      they can fit in any composition and making an army solely made of marines
      is a completely viable option.

    <br />
    <h2>Zerg</h2>

    />
    <p>
      Even if you have never played starcraft 1 or 2, you have probably heard
      the term "Zerg" used at some point in another game. Zerg, much like its
      namesake, employ a tactic of "Everyone is expandable". Your units are,
      besides a few outliers, fast to produce, fast to move, and fast to die.
      The goal of someone playing against zerg is to contain them and prevent
      them from expanding out of control. If you let the Zerg player do anything
      they want, you are in for a drawn out battle of attrition.

    <h2>Protoss</h2>

    />
    <p>
      Now for my favorite faction in starcraft, and possibly all of sci-fi, the
      Protoss. The protoss have the most advanced technology in the setting, and
      use it with deadly efficiency. The basic Zealot alone is durable and able
      to withstand heavy punishment. This is a theme which is carried throughout
      most of the protoss roster. This is balanced out by units being slower and
      more expensive to build. They also have possibly the strongest air units
      in the game. A common strategy of Protoss is to Construct a large amount
      of gateways to quickly respond to threats, and maxing out their population
      with a massive fleet of starships, able to tear armies to shreds under
      hails of laser fire.
      <br />
      <br />
      As an addition, the Protoss also have my favorite varieties of characters.
      The Daelaam (known as the unified protoss) are the combination of all the
      different groups of protoss. Led by the Heirarch Artanis, they work
      together to fight against an ultimate evil. Within the Daelaam, there are
      4 primary factions of protoss, each with their own style: The Aiur, the
      Nerazim, the Purifiers, and the Tal'Darim.
    </p>
    <img

      height="500"
    />
    <p>
      The first Protoss faction are the Aiur Protoss, also known as the Templar.
      Aiur is the name of the protoss homeworld, and as such, their design is
      the baseline for all other protoss. The design of the Templar Protoss is
      based with a primary of gold, and accents of blue. Their units are
      versatile and powerful.

    />
    <p>
      Next on the list, we have the Nerazim, also known as the Dark Templar,
      were founded millenia ago by a group of protoss exiled from their
      homeworld of Aiur. They specialize in stealth warfare, striking from the
      shadows and destroying their enemies before they can react. During the
      events of starcraft 1, a large number of Aiur Protoss worked together with
      the Nerazim to destroy an existential threat to their species. Since that
      point, The Aiur and Nerazim protoss had joined together, which would then
      become known as the Daelaam.

      width="700"
      height="400"
    />
    <p>
      Third, we have the Purifiers, lead by Fenix. The Purifiers were an ancient
      research project which was sealed away many years ago. They are a legion
      of Cybernetic warriors, each one a near perfect recreation of a Protoss
      warrior who fell in battle. Fenix, in particular, was a major character in
      starcraft 1 who was struck down once as a zealot, reborn as a dragoon,
      destroyed again, and after this, his personality was transferred into a
      Purifier body. The purifiers, before they joined with the unified Protoss,
      were treated awfully. They were seen by the researchers who built them as
      mere robots, and not brave warriors. After Artanis and his forces fought
      alongside the Purifiers, the Purifiers were to be treated as equals, and
      they joined the Daelaam.

      height="400"
    />
    <p>
      Finally, we have the Tal'Darim. The Tal'Darim begin the game as one of the
      primary antagonists, alongside the Terran "Mobieus Corps" and the Zerg
      under the control of the dark god Amon. The Tal'Darim strictly follow a
      policy of might makes right. Each Protoss within the Tal'Darim faction is
      strictly kept in their place in the heirarchy. If one protoss believes
      that they are stronger than the Protoss directly above him, he can ascend
      to their position by a rite of combat, known as Rak'Shir. This exists to
      ensure that the Tal'Darims leaders are as strong as possible, and their
      leadership is absolute. Once the Daelaam had fought to have one of the
      their Tal'Darim "allies" placed on the throne of the faction, Alarak, the
      new Highlord of the Tal'Darim fought alongside the Daelaam to the end of
      the war, but never truly integrated with them.
