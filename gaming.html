      I play a a lot of video games in my free time. its fast, and can be
      started up faster than the preparation time with something like painting
      or exercising. The games that i enjoy playing are primarily strategy
      games. of these strategy games, there are 3 that i enjoy the most.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Starcraft 2</h2>
    <p>
      Starcraft 2 is one of my favorite games that i have played. It's a Real
      Time Strategy game made by Blizzard in 2010, with DLC content releasing in
      2013 and 2015.
      <br />
      In this game, you select one of 3 races to play:
      <br />
    </p>
    <h2>Terran</h2>

    <p>
      The Terran's strengths depend on strong static fortresses on defense, and
      heavy armor supported by hordes of expendable infantry. A standard Terran
      marine alone cannot do very much, but they are cheap and fast to produce.
      they can fit in any composition and making an army solely made of marines
      is a completely viable option.

    <h2>Zerg</h2>
    <img src="images/ZergInsignia.png" width="200" height="200" />
    <p>
      Even if you have never played starcraft 1 or 2, you have probably heard
      the term "Zerg" used at some point in another game. Zerg, much like its
      namesake, employ a tactic of "Everyone is expandable". Your units are,
      besides a few outliers, fast to produce, fast to move, and fast to die.
      The goal of someone playing against zerg is to contain them and prevent
      them from expanding out of control. If you let the Zerg player do anything
      they want, you are in for a drawn out battle of attrition.

    <h2>Protoss</h2>
    <img src="images/ProtossSymbol.webp" height="300" width="200" />
    <p>
      Now for my favorite faction in starcraft, and possibly all of sci-fi, the
      Protoss. The protoss have the most advanced technology in the setting, and
      use it with deadly efficiency. The basic Zealot alone is durable and able
      to withstand heavy punishment. This is a theme which is carried throughout
      most of the protoss roster. This is balanced out by units being slower and
      more expensive to build. They also have possibly the strongest air units
      in the game. A common strategy of Protoss is to Construct a large amount
      of gateways to quickly respond to threats, and maxing out their population
      with a massive fleet of starships, able to tear armies to shreds under
      hails of laser fire.
